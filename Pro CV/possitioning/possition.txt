display {
  inline - divide same line;

  inline-block - you can change width and keep in same line;
  none - remove element from website as it did not exist   ->  also try "visabiliti:hidden"
}


position{
  static - by default;
  relative - relative to how it would be to statick example left:30px is left 30 from default L R T B
	* can overlap other elements!
  absulute - relative to the nearest parent

 
float and clear: (use only to wrap text around photos. Not for possitioning) 
  div_parent
  div-1 , div-2 div-3
    div-1 float:left - moves to left div-2 automaticly moves to right
       div-3 {clear:left} - then left is not applied
